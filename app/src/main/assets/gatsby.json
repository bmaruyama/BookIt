        "description": "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. ‘F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby was first published on April 10, 1925. Set on Long Island’s North Shore and in New York City during the summer of 1922, it is the story of an attractive young man, hopelessly in love, who, having worked so hard to improve himself so he can win back the woman he loves, finds himself in a world where money has replaced humility and despair has replaced hope. For me, the novel is a comment on the values and cynicism of east coast America almost a hundred years ago, a time when a section of society had suddenly become very wealthy and the American Dream was for most, nothing more than the mere pursuit of money.’ Peter Joucla ‘Peter Joucla’s surprisingly clear-eyed adaptation cuts to the heart of Fitzgerald’s text while preserving a very decent amount of it.’ 4 stars –Evening Standard ‘Evoking all the glamour and atmosphere of the roaring twenties, Wilton’s brings Gatsby to glorious, all-singing, all-dancing life (jazz hands optional). A must-see’ – welovethisbook.com ‘An unashamed nostalgia party for a world we never knew... This is a show that majors in fun; and it’s no surprise to see it’s a cult hit.’ Telegraph",

        "description": "The Great Gatsby is a novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald and first published in 1925. It follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (1896 – 1940) was an American author of novels and short stories, whose works are the paradigmatic writings of the Jazz Age, a term he coined. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.",

But how well do we really know The Great Gatsby? As Maureen Corrigan, Gatsby lover extraordinaire, points out, while Fitzgerald's masterpiece may be one of the most popular novels in America, many of us first read it when we were too young to fully comprehend its power. Offering a fresh perspective on what makes Gatsby great-and utterly unusual-So We Read On takes us into archives, high school classrooms, and even out onto the Long Island Sound to explore the novel's hidden depths, a journey whose revelations include Gatsby's surprising debt to hard-boiled crime fiction, its rocky path to recognition as a \"classic,\" and its profound commentaries on the national themes of race, class, and gender. With rigor, wit, and infectious enthusiasm, Corrigan inspires us to re-experience the greatness of Gatsby and cuts to the heart of why we are, as a culture, \"borne back ceaselessly\" into its thrall. Along the way, she spins a new and fascinating story of her own.",

Scott Fitzgerald introduces the reader to the post-war America and offers a gripping social commentary on the themes of power, crime, betrayal, greed and a vivid peek into the American life in the 1920s, also known as the ‘Roaring Twenties’. In the summer of 1922, Nick Carraway arrives in New York in pursuit of the big American dream. Nick, the story’s narrator, moves in next door to the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, the host of lavish weekly parties for the rich and the fashionable. Across the bay reside Nick’s distant cousin Daisy and her philandering husband, Tom, an old classmate from Yale. Being the only link between Gatsby and his long lost love, Nick gets drawn into the enthralling world of the rich and takes the reader along on the ride, as he bears witness to their follies and emerges a new enlightened man.",
